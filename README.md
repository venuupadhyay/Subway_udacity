# Subway_udacity

Introduction
The NYC public transportantion system - Metro Transit Authority - provides data for download via csv files. Part of the information available are data from the subway turnstiles, containing weekly logs for cumulative entries and exits by turnstile and by subway station during a provided timeframe.

For this project, we will only use the information available at: http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html.

About this project
For this project, you will apply the knowledge acquired in the first month of this course. We will practice basic data acquisition and data cleaning tasks to find out fundamental stuff about the data using what we learned in the Statistics course.

The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between data from the NYC Subway turnstiles and the city weather. For this, besides data from the subway, we will also need data from the weather in NYC.

Here are the main points that will be considered in this work:

Gathering data from the Internet
Using Statistics for Data Analysis
Data handling and simple graphics creation with Pandas
